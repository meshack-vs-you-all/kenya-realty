# Navigating the Kenyan Real Estate Market

Buying property in Kenya is a significant milestone and a powerful investment. However, it requires a clear understanding of the local landscape, from land titles to financing options.

## 1. Understanding Land Titles
In Kenya, land is generally held under three categories:
- **Freehold:** Absolute ownership of the land.
- **Leasehold:** Ownership for a specific period (usually 99 years in urban areas like Nairobi).
- **Sectional Titles:** Common for apartments in areas like Kilimani and Westlands.

## 2. The Verification Process
Never commit funds without conducting a proper search at the **Ministry of Lands**. This ensures the title is genuine and free of encumbrances.

## 3. Financial Considerations
- **Stamp Duty:** Typically 4% for urban property and 2% for rural property.
- **Legal Fees:** Usually 1-2% of the purchase price.
- **Valuation Fees:** Required by lenders if you are taking a mortgage.

## 4. Why Use an Agent?
A professional agency like **Kenya Realty** provides vetted listings, handles the negotiation process, and ensures all legal documentation is in order, saving you time and mitigating risk.
